## About Us

The Association for Computer Studies Education (ACSE) is a province-wide volunteer-run subject association dedicated to supporting Computer Studies and Computer Technology education in Ontario. Our mandate is to provide multi-faceted support for educators and students by:

* providing a unified voice for Computer Studies and Computer Technology teachers;
* improving information sharing across the secondary level;
* facilitating dialogue with colleges and universities;
* facilitating dialogue with business and industry;
* creating new opportunities for teacher training; and
* supporting the development of teaching resources.

ACSE supports teachers through the provision of conferences and on-line resources. ASCE also interacts with organizations such as the Ministry of Education and the Ontario College of Teachers on key issues such as:

* teacher certification;
* opportunities for in-service and upgrading;
* administration;
* resource allocation; and
* the development of curriculum resources.

ACSE is a volunteer-run organization that draws its membership from Computer Studies and Computer Technology educators, encompassing elementary, high schools, colleges, and universities.
